        <li>
          <p><strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong> If you operate an account, comment on an account, post material to the Website, post links on the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;</li>
            <li>if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;</li>
            <li>you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>
            <li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
            <li>the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>
            <li>the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;</li>
            <li>your account is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;</li>
            <li>you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Assembly or otherwise.
              By submitting Content to Assembly for inclusion on your Website, you grant Assembly a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your blog. This license allows Assembly to make publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by Assembly (through the Assembly Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Assembly has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Assembly’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Assembly’s reasonable opinion, violates any Assembly policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in Assembly’s sole discretion. Assembly will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
    </p>
      
        <li>
          <p><strong>General Terms.</strong>
          Optional paid services are available on the Website (any such services, an "Upgrade"). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Assembly the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong>
          Unless you notify Assembly before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your site's dashboard.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Responsibility of Website Visitors.</strong> Assembly has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating the Website, Assembly does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. Assembly disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Intellectual Property.</strong> This Agreement does not transfer from Assembly to you any Assembly or third party intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Assembly.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Changes.</strong> We are constantly updating our services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new Terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using SignupSumo.com within the designated notice period. Your continued use of SignupSumo.com will be subject to the new Terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Termination.</strong> Assembly may terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.

(“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court.

A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Assembly may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition.
